Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.
Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal
to the remainder.
Example pseudo-code:
groupArrayElements([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ], 3 );
// [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5 ] ]
